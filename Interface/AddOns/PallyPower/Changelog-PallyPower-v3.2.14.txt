- Re-implemented the primary and secondary spec changes. Now going to use config sets instead of profiles. Please revert your profile back to "Default".
- Fixed the aura assignment save
- Now the spec change only triggers the set change only if you're playing a paladin
- Added a command to purge old assignments from SavedVariables. Use "/script PallyPower:Purge()"
